# Functional Programming Exercises

This repository contains Python exercises that demonstrate key concepts in functional programming. The code is organized into directories covering comprehensions, first-class functions, higher-order functions, and refactoring imperative code to declarative style.

## Structure

- **coperhensions**: Examples of list, dictionary, and set comprehensions.
- **higher_order_functions**: Usage of `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and other higher-order functions.
- **imperative_to_declarative**: Refactoring examples from imperative to declarative programming.
